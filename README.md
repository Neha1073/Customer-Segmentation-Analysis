    <h1>Customer Segmentation for E-Commerce</h1>
    
  <p>In e-commerce companies, understanding customer behavior is crucial for maximizing revenue, improving customer retention, discovering trends, and identifying at-risk customers. This notebook focuses on customer segmentation by leveraging transaction data. The primary goal is to cluster customers to gain actionable insights for better decision-making.</p>
    
  <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Increase Revenue</strong>: Identify customers contributing most to revenue.</li>
        <li><strong>Increase Customer Retention</strong>: Recognize customers with high retention potential.</li>
        <li><strong>Discover Trends and Patterns</strong>: Uncover significant trends and behavioral patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Define Customers at Risk</strong>: Identify customers who may be at risk of churning.</li>
    </ul>
    
  <h2>Methodology</h2>
    
   <h3>1. RFM Analysis</h3>
    <p>RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis is used to segment customers based on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Recency</strong>: How recently a customer has made a purchase.</li>
        <li><strong>Frequency</strong>: How often a customer makes a purchase.</li>
        <li><strong>Monetary</strong>: How much money a customer spends.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>RFM Analysis helps answer:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Who are our best customers?</li>
        <li>Who has the potential to become more profitable?</li>
        <li>Which customers should we retain?</li>
        <li>Which customers are likely to respond to current campaigns?</li>
    </ul>
    
   <h3>2. Combining RFM with Predictive Algorithms</h3>
    <p>Following RFM Analysis, K-means clustering is used to segment customers into distinct groups based on their RFM scores. This allows for more precise targeting and personalized strategies.</p>
    
  <h3>Steps in the Notebook:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Data Preparation</strong>: Load and preprocess transaction data.</li>
        <li><strong>RFM Calculation</strong>: Compute Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer.</li>
        <li><strong>RFM Segmentation</strong>: Classify customers into segments based on RFM scores.</li>
        <li><strong>K-means Clustering</strong>: Apply K-means clustering to the RFM data to create customer segments.</li>
        <li><strong>Analysis and Insights</strong>: Analyze the segments to extract actionable insights for business strategies.</li>
    </ol>
    
   <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Python 3.x</li>
        <li>Pandas</li>
        <li>NumPy</li>
        <li>Scikit-learn</li>
        <li>Seaborn</li>
        <li>Matplotlib</li>
    </ul>
    
   <h2>Usage</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Load the Data</strong>: Ensure the transaction data is in the expected format.</li>
        <li><strong>Run the Notebook</strong>: Execute cells sequentially to perform RFM Analysis and K-means clustering.</li>
        <li><strong>Interpret Results</strong>: Review the cluster outputs and segment analysis to gain insights.</li>
    </ol>
    
  <h2>Example Output</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>RFM Score Summary</strong>: Overview of customer segments based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores.</li>
        <li><strong>Cluster Analysis</strong>: Insights from K-means clustering, including customer group characteristics and trends.</li>
    </ul>
